Question 1

Robotic moves

You have designed a robot. The robot can move only left or right based on the given instruction. The robot is initially at point 0 on the X-axis. You are given N pairs of instructions. Each pair of instruction contains an integer and a character ('L' or 'R'). For example, consider an instruction (3, R), it means that the robot has to move 3 units right from the current position along the X-axis. You are allowed to perform the following operations at
most once:

You can remove any number of consecutive instructions but the condition is that the number of left and right instructions should be 
equal.

For example, you can remove (2, L), (3R) or (2, L), (3R), (4R). (6L). But you can't remove (2L) or (2L), (3L) or (3R).
You are required to find the maximum distance the robot can go from Initial point 0.

Input format
. The first line contains 7 denoting the number of test cases.
. The first line contains N denoting the number of instructions.
â€¢ Next N lines contain N sets of instructions where each line contains space-separated, an integer (D) and a character (or 'R).

Output format
Print the maximum distance the robot can go from Initial point 0 in a new line,
