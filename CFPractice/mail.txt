Respected Ma'am, 

I have been offered an extended internship from 2 months to 6 months by Siemens.
My Internship started in Dec, 2021 and now my internship will go on this whole semester up to June 2022.
Permission for applying for 6 months internship was approved earlier by you and Dean Academics. Documents are attached with this mail.

Talking about my credit management in the upcoming semesters.
Credits Management:-
    1. I have completed 18 credits (1st sem) + 22 (2nd Sem) + 16 (3rd Sem) + 22 (4th Sem) + 24 (5th Sem) = 102 Credits.
    Total Credits completed upto 5th Sem: 102 Credits.

    2. For upcoming semesters, 9 P/F credits + 2 Internship Credits  = 11 Credits will be counted in that case. And will be taking courses of 6 credits this sem(6th).
    That is, a total of 102 + 11  = 113 credits will be completed by 6th Sem.
    
    Total Credits completed upto 6th Sem: 102 + 11(9 P/F + 2 Intern Credits) + 6(2 Courses) Credits = 119

    3. Now, to complete my BTech, I would have to complete 41 credits which can be managed in (20 + 21) credits split in 7th and 8th semester.

I request you to please approve my 6 Months Internship. 
I will be very thankful to you.

Thanks and Regards,
